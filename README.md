## Project Overview

This is the official website for AIH Toledo, built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

npm install

yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# or
yarn build
